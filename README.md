# My Travel Journal 

This is CLI inspired by a conversation between friends. Some people have travel goals such as to visit each state in a country or a specific country or place. 


This is a simple CLI that allows a user to create a list of places he or she has traveled to. 
Users can also add reviews to each place that includes details such as how affordable or safe a place is, how the good is the food, and how much entertainment is found at that place.  Each review also includes a place for users to record any other thoughts they have about the place. 

Once places and reviews have been added users can search the places visited, see the reviews for each place, add and delete reviews and places if necesary. 

A user can also search reviews to find places that have a particular rating. For example you can search reviews for places with a 5 star rating on any of the review categories.
